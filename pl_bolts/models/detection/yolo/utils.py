    The predicted coordinates are interpreted as coordinates inside a grid cell whose width and height is 1. Adding

    The function needs the ``@torch.jit.script`` decorator in order for ONNX generation to work. The tracing based
    generator will loose track of e.g. ``xy.shape[1]`` and treat it as a Python variable and not a tensor. This will
    cause the dimension to be treated as a constant in the model, which prevents dynamic input sizes.
